## üî∏ System Flow

### Step-by-Step Flow

#### 1. Student & Class Setup (Admin/Teacher)
- The **Admin/Teacher** adds students to the system.
- Each student is assigned to a **class** and **section** (e.g., "Grade 5 - A").
- **Subjects** are configured for each class (e.g., Math, Science, English).

#### 2. Subject Marks Entry 
- The **Teacher** enters the marks for each student under the relevant subject.
- For each student and subject, the marks obtained and the maximum marks are recorded.
- Additionally, the teacher provides **comments** for each subject based on the student's performance (e.g., "Good progress", "Needs improvement").

#### 3. Comments Entry (Optional)
- The **Principal** provides additional feedback, if necessary, for each student.
- The **grade** (e.g., "Grade A+ - Pass") is calculated automatically based on the student's performance across all subjects.

#### 4. Report Card Generation (System)
- The system aggregates the following data for the report card:
  - Student personal details (name, roll number, class, section)
  - Subject-wise marks and comments
  - **Final grade** based on the marks entered (calculated automatically)
  - **Overall comments** provided by the teacher and principal

#### 5. Report Card Preview
- The system generates a **report card preview**.
- The report card is displayed with:
  - Student details
  - Subject-wise marks and comments
  - Final grade and overall comments

#### 6. Downloadable PDF 
- Upon clicking the Download button, the user can download the report card in **PDF format**.
- The system generates a **PDF file** using libraries like **FPDF** or tools like **ReportLab**, ensuring it is properly styled and formatted for printing or sharing.
